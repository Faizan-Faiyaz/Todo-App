# Todo-App

This Todo App project features a minimalist design that prioritizes ease of use and task management. The app consists of three main components: an input field for entering tasks, an optional date input to set due dates, and an 'Add' button to add tasks to the list. When the user clicks 'Add,' JavaScript captures the input and dynamically displays the task in the Todo list below. The todo-container holds and shows all tasks. Furthermore, the app utilizes local storage to persist task data, ensuring that the todo list is preserved even after the browser is closed and reopened. The project utilizes HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling dynamic task addition, ensuring a clean and user-friendly experience for efficient task management.
